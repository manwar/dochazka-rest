DISPATCH_TOO_MANY_RECORDS_FOUND message should be triggered when the
interval/lock SELECT limit is reached. This mechanism should be documented.

We also need to document the DBIx::Connector object in the request context:
where it is instantiated, how it gets into the context.

In dbinit_Config.pm there is a stored procedure called not_too_future()
which is used in triggers to prevent users from entering locks and intervals
that extent too far into the future. What constitutes "too far" should be a
matter of site policy, but currently the value (a PostgreSQL interval) is
hard-coded in the stored procedure itself. That means it can never be changed.  . .

It is finally time to implement the original vision of having a "policy" table
in the database, containing values like this one.
