In config/sql/dbinit_Config.pm, we define a schedule_change_during_range() stored
procedure like so:

    q#-- given an EID and a tstzrange, IF a single SID applies throughout
      -- the entire range, returns that SID, otherwise NULL
      CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION schedule_change_during_range(INTEGER, TSTZRANGE)
      RETURNS boolean AS $$
          SELECT $2::tstzrange @> effective AS schedule_change_during_range 
              FROM schedhistory WHERE eid=$1;
      $$ LANGUAGE sql IMMUTABLE#,

This is problematic because if the range is e.g. [ 2015-01-01, ... ) and there
is a schedhistory record with timestamp 2015-01-01 00:00, the stored procedure
will return true. We need to allow a schedule change on the range boundary
provided that boundary is inclusive.
