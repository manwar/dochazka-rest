docker-test.sh should take an optional argument - the name of a git branch
to check out.

docker/Dockerfile should use ENTRYPOINT to enable us to specify name of git
branch as an argument to "docker build"

make a Dockerfile.in that can be used with multiple SUSE versions;

write a Makefile that generates Dockerfiles for multiple SUSE versions

run the test suite in Leap, SLE12, Tumbleweed, etc.

open up port 5432 in postmaster.conf on dochazka-devel.suse.cz (also check
pg_hba.conf and firewall) so we can connect to the "production" database
remotely by changing the value of DOCHAZKA_DBHOST

CLI BUG: intervals not shown in temporal order. When there is an interval
that straddles the day boundary, e.g. [ 2016-01-03 23:00, 2016-01-04 01:00 )
the "interval fetch" command for 2016-01-04 fails to list the day's intervals
in order:

Dochazka(2016-01-04) active ACTIVE> interval fetch 2016-01-04
Attendance intervals of active (EID 44)
in the range [ 2016-01-04 00:00, 2016-01-04 24:00 )

IID Begin            End              Code Description
431 2016-01-04 08:00 2016-01-04 12:00 WORK Riding on the Metro
432 2016-01-04 00:00 2016-01-04 01:00 WORK Dozing off

I think this is because we are relying on "ORDER BY" in the SELECT
statement to do the ordering. This worked fine before, but now we are
using two SELECTs and concatenating the results. This places the partial
intervals at the end. This will have to be fixed on the server side by
adding logic to sort the intervals.
