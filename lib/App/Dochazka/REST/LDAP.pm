=head1 EXPORTS

=cut

use Exporter qw( import );

=head1 METHODS


=head2 ldap_exists

Takes a nick. Returns true or false. Determines if the nick exists in the LDAP database.
Any errors in communication with the LDAP server are written to the log.

=cut

# $ldap and $dn are used by both 'ldap_exists' and 'ldap_search'
my ( $ldap, $dn );

sub ldap_exists {
    my ( $nick ) = validate_pos( @_, { type => SCALAR } );

    return 0 unless $site->DOCHAZKA_LDAP;

    require Net::LDAP; 

    my $server = $site->DOCHAZKA_LDAP_SERVER;
    $ldap = Net::LDAP->new( $server );
    $log->error("$@") unless $ldap;
    return 0 unless $ldap;

    $log->info( "Connected to LDAP server $server to look up $nick" );
    
    if ( $dn = ldap_search( $ldap, $nick ) ) {
        $log->info( "Found employee $nick in LDAP (DN $dn)" );
        return 1;
    }
    return 0;
}


=head2 ldap_search

Given Net::LDAP handle, LDAP field, and nick, search for the nick in
the given field (e.g. 'uid', 'cn' etc.). 

=cut

sub ldap_search {
    my ( $ldap, $nick ) = @_;
    $nick = $nick || '';
    my $base = $site->DOCHAZKA_LDAP_BASE || '';
    my $field = $site->DOCHAZKA_LDAP_NICK_MAPPING || ''; 
    my $filter = $site->DOCHAZKA_LDAP_FILTER || '';

                                           "($field=$nick)" .
                                           ")"
                                    );

    my ($mesg, $entry, $count);

    $log->info( "Running LDAP search with filter " . $filter->as_string );

    $mesg = $ldap->search(
                           base => "$base",
                           scope => "sub",
                           filter => $filter
                         );

    # code == 0 is success, code >= 1 is failure
    die $mesg->error unless $mesg->code == 0;

    $count = 0;
    for $entry ($mesg->entries) {
        $count += 1;
        if ($count == 1) {
            $dn = $entry->dn();
            last;
        }
    }
    return $dn if $count > 0;
    return;
}


=head2 ldap_auth

Takes a nick and a password. Returns true or false. Determines if the password matches
the one stored in the LDAP database.

=cut

sub ldap_auth {
    no strict 'subs';
    my ( $nick, $password ) = @_;
    return 0 unless $nick;
    $password = $password || '';

    return 0 unless $site->DOCHAZKA_LDAP;

    require Net::LDAP;
    require Net::LDAP::Filter;

    my $mesg = $ldap->bind( "$dn",
                           password => "$password",
                       );
    if ( $mesg->code == 0 ) {
        $ldap->unbind;
        $log->info("Access granted to $nick");
        return 1;
    }
    $log->info("Access denied to $nick because LDAP server returned code " . $mesg->code);
    return 0;
}
